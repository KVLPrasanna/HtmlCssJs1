           Maybe it's the way you say my name
           Maybe it's the way you play your game
           But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you
           But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you<br>
           And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
           And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine<br>
           'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
           Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
           And I see forever in your eyes
           I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br>
           Wishing on dandelions all of the time
           Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
           Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time<br>
           I think that you are the one for me
           'Cause it gets so hard to breathe
           When you're looking at me, I've never felt so alive and free
           When you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy<br>
           And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
           And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine<br>
           'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
           Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
           And I see forever in your eyes
           I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br>
           Wishing on dandelions all of the time
           Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
           Wishing on dandelions all of the time
           All of the time<br>
           Dandelion, into the wind you go
           Won't you let my darling know?
           Dandelion, into the wind you go
           Won't you let my darling know that?<br>
           I'm in a field of dandelions
           Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
           Oh, and I see forever in your eyes
           I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br>
           Wishing on dandelions all of the time
           Praying to God that one day you'll be mine
           Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time<br>
           I'm in a field of dandelions
           Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine
